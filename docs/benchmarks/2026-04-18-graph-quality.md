# Graph Quality Benchmark — PR #188

**Date:** 2026-04-18
**Branch:** garrytan/link-timeline-extract
**Version:** v0.10.3

## What this PR does

Before v0.10.3, gbrain stored your knowledge as embeddings + chunks. Vector search worked.
But the structured `links` and `timeline_entries` tables were empty. Wintermute's audit
found 29,000 pages, 61,000 chunks, 100% embedding coverage... and zero links, zero timeline
entries. The graph layer existed in the schema but nothing populated it.

v0.10.3 turns the brain into a self-wiring knowledge graph:

- **Auto-link on every `put_page`** — entity references in content are extracted, typed,
  and linked. Stale links are reconciled when content changes.
- **`gbrain extract links --source db` / `extract timeline --source db`** — batch backfill
  for existing brains. Mutation-immune snapshot iteration handles 29K pages safely.
- **Typed link inference** — deterministic regex picks `attended`, `works_at`, `invested_in`,
  `founded`, `advises`, `source`, or `mentions` from context. Zero LLM calls.
- **Backlink-boosted hybrid search** — well-connected entities rank higher
  (`score *= 1 + 0.05 * log(1 + backlink_count)`).
- **`gbrain graph-query <slug>`** — typed-edge traversal with cycle prevention.
  `--type attended --depth 2` returns only attended-subgraph paths.

## How we test it

We built a synthetic YC-style portfolio brain with **80 fictional pages**:

- 25 people (5 partners, 10 founders, 5 engineers, 5 advisors)
- 25 companies (15 startups, 5 VC firms, 5 acquirers)
- 15 meetings (5 demo days, 5 1:1s, 5 board meetings)
- 15 concept pages (AI, fintech, climate, etc.)

Each page has known ground-truth relationships in its content: `[Person](people/slug)`
references, "CEO of X" patterns for `works_at`, attendee lists for meetings, "advises"
language for board roles, "invested in" for VC firms. We seed 90+ expected typed
relationships across the graph.

We run extraction end-to-end against PGLite (in-memory, no API keys, no network) and
measure:

| Metric | What it measures |
|--------|-----------------|
| **link_recall** | % of known relationships extract found |
| **link_precision** | % of extracted links that are real (no false positives) |
| **timeline_recall** | % of known dated events extract found |
| **timeline_precision** | % of extracted timeline entries that are correct |
| **type_accuracy** | % of inferred link types that match ground truth |
| **relational_recall** | % of "who works at X?" queries that return all known people |
| **relational_precision** | % of relational query results that are actually relevant |
| **idempotent_links** | Run twice → same result? |
| **idempotent_timeline** | Run twice → same result? |

## Results

| Metric                | Value | Target | Pass |
|-----------------------|-------|--------|------|
| link_recall           | 94.4% | >90.0% | ✓ |
| link_precision        | 100.0% | >95.0% | ✓ |
| timeline_recall       | 100.0% | >85.0% | ✓ |
| timeline_precision    | 100.0% | >95.0% | ✓ |
| type_accuracy         | 94.4% | >80.0% | ✓ |
| relational_recall     | 100.0% | >80.0% | ✓ |
| relational_precision  | 100.0% | >80.0% | ✓ |
| idempotent_links      | true  | true   | ✓ |
| idempotent_timeline   | true  | true   | ✓ |

Extracted **95 typed links** from 80 pages (vs 90 expected — small over-recall from bare
slug references that match real entities). Extracted **95 timeline entries** from dated
markdown sections.

## Type inference accuracy

The deterministic regex picks link types from surrounding text. Confusion matrix
(predicted → actual):

| Predicted | Distribution |
|-----------|-------------|
| `works_at` | 20 / 20 correct |
| `advises` | 10 / 10 correct |
| `invested_in` | 5 / 5 correct |
| `attended` | 35 / 35 correct (meeting page heuristic) |
| `mentions` | 15 mentions correct, 5 false negatives that were actually `invested_in` |

Why `mentions` confused with `invested_in`: VC firm pages used the phrase "portfolio
includes [X]" which doesn't match the `invested in|backed by|funding from` regex. Fix
options for v0.10.4: extend the regex, or accept that VC pages need explicit `invested_in`
markers in content. For now: 94.4% type accuracy is above the 80% target.

## Idempotency

Running `extract --source db` twice produces the same result. The unique constraint
`UNIQUE(from_page_id, to_page_id, link_type)` (migration v5) handles link dedup.
The `UNIQUE INDEX (page_id, date, summary)` on timeline_entries (migration v6)
handles timeline dedup. Auto-link reconciliation (`getLinks` + diff + `removeLink`)
prunes stale references when page content changes.

This matters for cron-style maintenance. Wintermute can run `extract --source db`
nightly and not blow up the link table.

## Relational query accuracy

The graph layer makes questions like "who works at Acme AI?" and "who attended this
meeting?" answerable. Without the graph, the agent would do keyword search and miss
people who aren't textually adjacent.

Tested 5 relational queries against the seeded graph:
- "Who works at startup-N?" → 100% recall (founders + engineers found)
- "Who advises company-N?" → 100% recall (advisor links found)
- "What did partner-N invest in?" → 100% recall (VC investment chain)
- "Who attended demo-day-N?" → 100% recall (attendee list traversal)
- "Path from person-A to person-B?" → 100% recall (2-hop via shared meeting)

100% relational recall on the seeded graph. Real-world recall depends on extraction
recall (94.4%), which depends on whether content uses recognizable patterns.

## What shipped in PR #188

1. **`src/core/link-extraction.ts`** — shared library: `extractEntityRefs`, `extractPageLinks`,
   `inferLinkType`, `parseTimelineEntries`, `isAutoLinkEnabled`. Replaces the duplicated
   regex in `backlinks.ts`.
2. **Auto-link in `put_page` operation** — runs inside the transaction after `importFromContent`.
   Reconciles stale links via `getLinks` diff. Returns `auto_links: { created, removed, errors }`
   in the operation response. Skipped when `ctx.remote === true` for security.
3. **`gbrain extract <kind> --source db`** — batch backfill using mutation-immune snapshot
   iteration (`getAllSlugs()`). Filters: `--type`, `--since`, `--limit`, `--dry-run` (JSON).
4. **`gbrain graph-query`** — typed-edge traversal with `--type`, `--depth`, `--direction`.
   Recursive CTE with visited-array cycle prevention.
5. **Backlink-boosted hybrid search** — `applyBacklinkBoost` after RRF + cosine re-score.
   Also applied in keyword-only path for installs without `OPENAI_API_KEY`.
6. **Schema migrations v5/v6/v7** — multi-type link constraint, timeline dedup index,
   drop legacy timeline search trigger (was breaking pagination).
7. **Graph health metrics** — `link_coverage`, `timeline_coverage`, `most_connected`
   in `gbrain health`. Postgres/PGLite `orphan_pages` definition aligned.
8. **Skill updates** — `brain-ops` Phase 2.5 declares auto-link. `meeting-ingestion`,
   `signal-detector`, `enrich` updated. `RESOLVER.md` adds graph-query and graph
   population entries.
9. **Migration file `skills/migrations/v0.10.3.md`** — agent instructions for `gbrain init`
   (auto-applies migrations) + `extract links/timeline --source db` for backfill.
10. **This benchmark** — 80 pages, 9 thresholds, reproducible, no API keys.

## How to reproduce

```bash
bun run test/benchmark-graph-quality.ts
```

Runs in ~3 seconds against in-memory PGLite. No API keys, no database, no network.
Exits non-zero if any threshold fails.

## Methodology notes

- **Synthetic data, not private brain.** All 80 pages are fictional. We don't expose
  real Wintermute content. Reproducibility matters more than realism.
- **Extraction-only benchmark.** We don't measure search nDCG@k delta with the backlink
  boost. The existing search-quality benchmark covers nDCG; this one covers structural
  extraction. A future bench could combine them (A/B/C with graph vs no-graph search).
- **Bare-slug references.** The benchmark seeds entities both as `[Name](people/slug)`
  markdown links AND as bare `people/slug` references in text. Real brains use both;
  the extractor handles both via the canonical `extractEntityRefs` regex.
- **No LLM calls.** Type inference is regex-only. Faster, cheaper, deterministic.
  Trade-off: VC `invested_in` recall depends on content using "invested in" / "backed by"
  language. A future LLM-tier could close that gap if needed.

## Next steps

- v0.10.4: extend `invested_in` regex (close the 5/20 gap above) and improve
  `gbrain post-upgrade` so the migration steps actually reach the agent.
- Future: combined search-quality benchmark with backlink boost A/B (does the graph
  improve nDCG@k on real entity queries, or just structural recall?).
