## What this benchmark proves

BrainBench v1 evaluates gbrain across 7 capability domains, run on TWO
corpora: small templated (29-80 pages) AND rich Opus-generated prose
(240 pages, real narrative text with typos and varied phrasing).
Reproducible (in-memory PGLite, no API keys at run time), runs in ~5min.

### Headline finding: rich-prose corpus reveals real degradation

Same algorithm, different corpus, big delta:

| Metric          | Templated | Rich-prose | Δ        |
|-----------------|-----------|------------|----------|
| Link recall     | 94.4%     | 76.6%      | -18 pts  |
| Link precision  | 100.0%    | 62.9%      | -37 pts  |
| Type accuracy   | 94.4%     | 70.7%      | -24 pts  |

Specifically: `invested_in` regex never matches the actual phrasings
an LLM produces ("led the seed round", "wrote a check", "participated
in funding"). 0/60 found `invested_in` links got the correct type;
all classified as `mentions`. This is a real v0.10.4 bug, surfaced by
the rich-corpus benchmark and invisible to the templated one. The
procedural categories all passed; rich corpus is what catches drift.

Categories not yet covered (deferred to BrainBench v1.1, see TODOS.md):
- Category 5: Source Attribution / Provenance
- Category 6: Auto-link Precision under Prose (at scale)
- Category 8: Skill Behavior Compliance (needs LLM agent loop)
- Category 9: End-to-End Workflows (needs LLM agent loop)
- Category 11: Multi-modal Ingestion

## Corpus generation cost

Rich-prose corpus generated via Claude Opus 4.7. 240 pages × ~$0.06/page = ~$15
one-time cost. Cached to `eval/data/world-v1/` and committed to the repo, so
subsequent runs are free. See `eval/data/world-v1/_ledger.json` for token
accounting.

# Search Quality Benchmark: 2026-04-18

## Overview

- **29 pages** (10 people, 10 companies, 9 concepts)
- **58 chunks** with overlapping semantic embeddings
- **20 queries** with graded relevance (1-3 grades, multiple relevant pages)
- **3 configurations:** baseline, boost only, boost + intent classifier

All data is fictional. No private information. Embeddings use shared topic dimensions
to simulate real semantic overlap (e.g., "AI" appears in health, education, design, robotics).

Inspired by [Ramp Labs' "Latent Briefing" paper](https://ramp.com) (April 2026).

## Analysis

### Improvements (C vs A)
- Unique pages: 7.2 → 8.7

### Boost-Only Damage Report (B vs A)

The boost without the intent classifier causes these regressions:

- Source accuracy drops: 89.5% → 63.2% (-26.3pp)
- Timeline accessibility drops: 100.0% → 71.4%
- P@1 drops: 0.947 → 0.895

The intent classifier recovers all of these by routing temporal/event queries to detail=high (no boost).

## Methodology

- **Engine:** PGLite (in-memory Postgres 17.5 via WASM)
- **Embeddings:** Normalized topic vectors with shared dimensions (25 topic axes)
- **Overlap:** Multiple pages share topics (e.g., 5 pages relevant for "AI companies")
- **Graded relevance:** 1-3 grades per query (3 = primary, 1 = tangentially relevant)

### Metrics explained

**Page-level (traditional IR):** P@k, Recall@k, MRR, nDCG@5 measure "did we find the right page?"

**Chunk-level (what matters for brain search):**
- **Source accuracy:** Is the very first chunk the right TYPE for this query? Entity lookup → compiled truth. Temporal query → timeline.
- **CT-first rate:** For entity queries, is compiled truth the FIRST chunk shown per page? (Not buried below timeline noise.)
- **Timeline accessible:** For temporal queries, do timeline chunks actually appear in results? (Not filtered out by the boost.)
- **CT guarantee:** Does every page in results have at least one compiled truth chunk? (Source-aware dedup.)
- **Chunks/page:** How many chunks per page appear? More = richer context for the agent.
- **Unique pages:** How many distinct pages in top-10? More = broader coverage.

### Configurations
- A. **Baseline:** RRF K=60, no normalization, no boost, text-prefix dedup key
- B. **Boost only:** RRF normalized to 0-1, 2.0x compiled_truth boost, chunk_id dedup key, source-aware dedup
- C. **Boost + Intent:** B + heuristic intent classifier auto-selects detail level. Entity queries get detail=low (CT only). Temporal/event queries get detail=high (no boost, natural ranking). General queries get default medium.

  advises:  {"advises":10}
  invested_in:  {"invested_in":5}
  mentions:  {"invested_in":5,"mentions":15}
  attended:  {"attended":35}

## Configuration A (no graph) vs C (full graph)
Same data, same queries. A = pre-v0.10.3 brain (no extract, fallback to
content scanning). C = full graph layer (typed traversal).

| Metric                 | A: no graph | C: full graph | Delta       |
|------------------------|-------------|----------------|-------------|
| relational_recall      | 100.0%      | 100.0%         | +0%         |
| relational_precision   | 58.8%       | 100.0%         | +70%        |

## Per-query: A vs C
Found = correct hits. Returned = total results (correct + noise).
Lower returned-count at same found-count means less noise to filter.

| Question                                 | Expected | A: found / returned | C: found / returned |
|------------------------------------------|----------|---------------------|---------------------|
| Who attended Demo Day 0?                 | 3        | 3 / 3               | 3 / 3               |
| Who attended Board 0?                    | 2        | 2 / 2               | 2 / 2               |
| What companies has uma-advisor advised?  | 2        | 2 / 2               | 2 / 2               |
| Who works at startup-0?                  | 2        | 2 / 5               | 2 / 2               |
| Which VCs invested in startup-0?         | 1        | 1 / 5               | 1 / 1               |

## Multi-hop traversal (depth 2)
Single-pass naive grep can't chain. C does it in one recursive CTE.

| Question                                 | Expected | A: found / returned | C: found / returned |
|------------------------------------------|----------|---------------------|---------------------|
| Who attended meetings with frank-founder | 3        | 0 / 1               | 3 / 3               |
| Who attended meetings with grace-founder | 5        | 0 / 1               | 5 / 5               |
| Who attended meetings with alice-partner | 2        | 0 / 0               | 2 / 2               |
Multi-hop recall: A vs C — 0 vs 10 of 10 expected. C aggregate: recall 100.0%, precision 100.0%.

## Aggregate queries
"Top N most-connected" — A counts text mentions, C counts dedupe'd structured links.

**Top 4 most-connected people (by inbound attended links)**
- Expected (any order): `people/grace-founder`, `people/henry-founder`, `people/iris-founder`, `people/jack-founder`
- A (text-mention count): `people/grace-founder`, `people/henry-founder`, `people/iris-founder`, `people/jack-founder` → ✓ matches
- C (structured backlinks): `people/grace-founder`, `people/henry-founder`, `people/iris-founder`, `people/jack-founder` → ✓ matches

## Type-disagreement queries (set intersection on inbound link types)
A must scan prose for verb patterns; C does two filtered getLinks + intersect.

**Startups with both VC investment AND advisor coverage**
- Expected: 5 startups (startup-0, startup-1, startup-2, startup-3, startup-4)
- A: 8 returned (startup-0, startup-1, startup-2, startup-3, startup-4, startup-5, startup-6, startup-7). Recall 100.0%, precision 62.5%.
- C: 5 returned (startup-0, startup-1, startup-2, startup-3, startup-4). Recall 100.0%, precision 100.0%.

## Search ranking with backlink boost
Keyword query that matches both well-connected and unconnected pages. Compare
average rank (lower = better) of each group before vs after applying the backlink
boost (`score *= 1 + 0.05 * log(1 + n)`).

**Keyword search for "company" — average rank of well-connected vs unconnected pages, before and after backlink boost**
| Group                                    | Avg rank without boost | Avg rank with boost | Δ |
|------------------------------------------|------------------------|---------------------|---|
| Well-connected (4 inbound links each)    | 3.5                    | 2.5                 | +1.0 ↑ better |
| Unconnected (0 inbound links each)       | 8.5                    | 8.5                 | +0.0  |

## What this benchmark surfaces
Keyword-only search (no embeddings) against 240 rich-prose pages.
Queries that found primary in top-5: 40/46
Queries that missed entirely (not in top-50): 5/46

Without OpenAI embeddings, semantic search is unavailable — the benchmark
measures pure tsvector/keyword performance on real prose. The backlink boost
moves well-connected entities up the ranking when keyword scores are tied.

# BrainBench Category 3: Identity Resolution

Generated: 2026-04-18T04:18:21
Entities: 100
Aliases per entity: 3 documented + 5 undocumented = 8 total
  Migration 2 applied: slugify_existing_pages
  Migration 3 applied: unique_chunk_index

  Migration 7 applied: drop_timeline_search_trigger

## Metrics
| Alias category   | Recall (top-10) | MRR    |
|------------------|-----------------|--------|
| Documented       | 100.0%             | 0.992  |
| Undocumented     | 31.0%             | 0.277  |

## Per-alias-type breakdown (documented)
  fullname   100/100 = 100.0%
  handle     100/100 = 100.0%
  email      100/100 = 100.0%

## Per-alias-type breakdown (undocumented)
  initial       15/100 = 15.0%
  no-period     15/100 = 15.0%
  typo          25/200 = 12.5%
  handle-plain  100/100 = 100.0%

## Interpretation
Documented aliases (full name, handle, email mentioned in canonical body):
  Recall 100.0% — what current gbrain can do via tsvector keyword match.
Undocumented aliases (initials, typos, handle without @):
  Recall 31.0% — what current gbrain CAN'T do without an alias table.

Gap: gbrain has no alias table, no fuzzy match, no nickname dictionary.
Suggested v0.11 feature: explicit aliases + Levenshtein/phonetic match.

  Average: R=100.0%, P=100.0%

## Recency queries (most recent 3 events per entity)
  30 entities × 3 most-recent events each
  Top-3 correctness: 100.0%

## As-of queries (HARD — no native gbrain operation)
  Approach: read full timeline, filter events ≤ asOfDate, take most-recent matching entry.
  50 as-of queries, 50 correct = 100.0%
  Note: requires manual filter+sort logic per query. A native `getStateAtTime`
  operation would make this trivial. Suggested v0.11 feature.

## Summary
| Sub-category    | Recall | Precision | Notes                                |

| Range           | 100.0% | 100.0%    | Same — manual cross-entity filter    |
| Recency (top-3) | 100.0% | —         | Per-entity, native getTimeline       |
